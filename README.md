## SLOWLIGHT

In this game, you must navigate within a large boundary box while avoiding contact with the objects flying around you! The game continues until you strike the boundary or another object. The catch? Light is 10m/s. Good luck!

To move:

 - Press space to accelerate forwards.
 - Press the left, right, up and down keys to steer in that direction.
